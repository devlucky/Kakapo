/**
 `PropertyPolicy` is an enum similar to `Optional` but with an additional case `.null`. It's only purpose is to be serialized in 3 different ways to cover all possible behaviors of an Optional property.
 
 - None:     Same behavior of `Optional.none`, the property is not included in the JSON
 - Null:     `Null` when serialized is `NSNull` that will result as a `null` property in the JSON
 - Some:     Serialize the associated object
